# ðŸŒ¾ Haystack 

A full-stack hotel booking application built as part of the web developer education program at Yrgo.

This farm-themed hotel website allows users to browse rooms, check availability, and make bookings with a calendar interface.

The project features tacky AI-generated images, but also a nice admin page, which the fictional hotel manager can access with an API-key to dynamically change room prices, feature prices, discounts and how many stars the hotel has.
